## Fun Fact

Outside of digital services, I’m a politically active subrural mom (of kids, pups, kits, chickens, plants... you name it), a prolific home chef, and exude major weekend DIY energy. I'm always exploring creative ways to solve problems and bring new ideas to light and bring that light into life.
