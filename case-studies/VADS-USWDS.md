# Case Study: Authenticated Design Patterns at VA.gov

Role: Senior Product Manager

Organization: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Agilesix

## Executive Summary

I led the development and scaling of authenticated design patterns to improve VA.gov experiences for Veterans while enabling adoption across other federal agencies through USWDS. These patterns addressed fragmented workflows, accessibility gaps, and inconsistent authenticated UI components. By applying human-centered design (HCD), agile practices, and cross-functional collaboration, my team delivered scalable, evidence-based components that enhanced usability, reduced custom code, and supported VA’s digital objectives.

## Executive Summary

At the Department of Veterans Affairs, I led a cross-functional team responsible for designing and scaling authenticated design patterns that improved user experiences for millions of Veterans on VA.gov. Our goal was to create reusable, adaptable components that could not only enhance workflows within VA products but also be adopted across other federal agencies via the US Web Design System (USWDS). By applying human-centered design (HCD) principles, agile practices, and iterative testing, we delivered solutions that improved usability, ensured accessibility, and reduced duplicate development work across teams.

## Challenge

Authenticated experiences at VA.gov have been, historically, very fragmented. Different teams developed their own workflows which leads to inconsistent UI, confusing interactions, and accessibility challenges. These conditions, coupled with shifting administrative priorities, created a high level of ambiguity: we knew we needed to improve Veterans’ experiences, but how to do it in a way that was scalable, reusable, and compliant was not clear.

Additionally, midway through our roadmapped objectives, the Office of the CTO (OCTO) shifted the team’s focus toward “blue-sky” initiatives which were focused on creating new, innovative solutions to explore personalization and efficiency in authenticated experiences. We had to pivot quickly, reprioritize our work, and adapt to new goals without losing the progress we had already made.

## Approach

To tackle this, I started by facilitating alignment sessions with leadership and stakeholders to clarify the revised objectives. I used tools like Mural, Figma and GitHub Projects to map user journeys, prioritize patterns, and define MVPs, ensuring that everyone on the team understood the new direction. We leaned heavily on facilitating new human-centered research, synthesizing past usability studies, and gathering stakeholder feedback to inform our design decisions. I collaborated closely with UX researchers and designers to validate assumptions, conduct accessibility testing with Veterans of varying abilities, and ensure that every pattern was inclusive and usable.

On the implementation side, we designed modular, reusable react-based components such as Prefilled Information, Service List Cards, and Personalized Form Flows for data like marital status and service history. These components included not only UI designs but also documentation, example code and governance guidance, making it easier for other teams to adopt them without custom development. 

The team followed agile workflows, breaking the work into manageable sprints, refining backlogs, and iteratively testing features. We worked through internal collaborational cycles at VA before presenting our work for inclusion in the US Web Design System at quarterly workshops held with executives at GSA and USDS.

## Outcome

Despite the pivot and the initial ambiguity, we successfully delivered a suite of authenticated design patterns that transformed VA.gov experiences for Veterans. These patterns were fully accessible, met Section 508/WCAG 2.1 standards, and were designed to be adopted across multiple teams and other federal agencies through USWDS. The patterns contributed directly to OCTO’s 2025 OKRs, improving user satisfaction, streamlining workflows, and reducing duplicate custom code. Beyond the immediate product impact, the work set a standard for how evidence-based, HCD-led design systems could scale in a complex, highly regulated environment.

## Key Takeaways

Working on authenticated design patterns at VA.gov reinforced the importance of human-centered thinking when developing scalable design systems. Navigating ambiguity and pivoting mid-project showed the value of cross-functional collaboration, iterative design, and agile delivery. By focusing on patterns that are reusable, adoptable, and inclusive, teams can achieve long-term impact, efficiency, and measurable improvement in user experiences—even in highly complex, regulated contexts.
