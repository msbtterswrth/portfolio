# Case Study: CMS Chat – AI-Powered Data Analysis for Federal Workflows

Role: HCD Product Lead / Senior Product Manager

Organization: Skyward – CMS Chat

Duration: 2025 – Present

## Executive Summary

At Skyward, I lead human-centered product strategy and design for CMS Chat, a conversational platform that helps federal employees at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid efficiently look up information, analyze data, extract insights, and complete complex workflows. The challenge was to integrate AI/ML capabilities into a tool that is usable, trustworthy, and accessible across a highly regulated environment. By combining human-centered design, agile practices, and technical expertise, I guide the development of features that simplify complex tasks, increase confidence in automated outputs, and ensure measurable impact for users.

## Challenge

Federal employees face several pain points when working with CMS data and processes:

**Manual Analysis:** Users have to sift through large datasets, leading to time-consuming workflows and increased risk of errors.

**Diverse Skill Levels:** Users range from technical novices to experienced analysts, requiring flexible interfaces that could meet varying levels of expertise.

**Trust in AI:** Users need to have confidence in AI-generated recommendations, with clear explanations and transparency in automated outputs.

**Compliance Requirements:** The platform has to adhere to strict federal data and security standards while delivering advanced AI functionality.

Adding to the challenge, the solution has to support adoption across the entire CMS worforce, which includes multiple teams and workflows all with different use cases, expectations and needs. 

## Approach

To address these challenges, I applied a structured, iterative, and HCD-driven approach:

**Discovery & Research**
I facilitated workshops, interviews, and research synthesis sessions with CMS users and stakeholders to understand workflows, pain points, and expectations for AI-assisted analysis and workflows. Insights were translated into journey maps, task scenarios and figma wireframes that guided design decisions.

**Iterative HCD Design**
Working closely with researchers, engineers, and stakeholders, I prototyped interfaces for LLM tool dashboards, MCP server dashboards, conversational workflows, and AI Assistants. Early testing with users ensured usability and alignment with real-world needs.

**Agile Product Leadership**
I managed backlog prioritization, sprint planning and roadmap alignment to focus on high-impact features first. Incremental releases allowed early validation and continuous refinement based on user feedback.

**AI/ML Integration**
Partnered with our engineering teams to implement LLM and RAG-based workflows, enabling:

- Automated summaries of user input or uploaded data
- Conversational queries for complex datasets
- Actionable recommendations to support decision-making

## Outcome

**Efficiency Gains:** Users can complete complex data tasks significantly faster, with reduced manual effort and error.
**Increased Confidence:** Transparent AI outputs and explainable recommendations improve trust and adoption.
**Accessibility:** All interfaces meet Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 standards, supporting diverse users.
**Agile Delivery:** Iterative development and rapid feedback loops allowed the team to adapt quickly to emerging requirements.
**Scalable Patterns:** Design patterns and reusable components are documented for cross-team adoption within a Figma Design system based on CMSDS/USWDS.

## Key Takeaways

- Integrating AI into high-stakes workflows requires human-centered design and iterative testing to ensure usability and trust.
- Agile practices allow teams to navigate uncertainty, pivot quickly, and deliver value incrementally.
- Well-documented design patterns and component libraries enable scalable adoption across multiple teams and platforms.
- Transparency in AI outputs is critical for adoption, especially among users unfamiliar with automated analysis.
